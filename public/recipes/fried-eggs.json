    "Heat margarine, butter or bacon fat in heavy skillet to 1/8-inch depth just until hot enough to sizzle a drop of water.  Break each egg into custard cup or saucer; carefully slip 1 egg at a time into skillet.  Immediately reduce heat to low.",
    "Cook, spooning margarine onto eggs, until whites are set and a film forms over yolks (sunny-side up).  Or gently turn eggs over when whites are set and cook until desired doneness."
