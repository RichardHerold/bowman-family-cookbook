    "COLD WATER METHOD:  Place eggs in saucepan; add enough cold water to come at least 1 inch above eggs.  Heat rapidly to boiling; remove from heat.  Cover and let stand until desired doneness, 1 to 3 minutes.  Immediately cool eggs in cold water for several seconds to prevent further cooking.  Cut eggs in halves; scoop eggs from shells."
