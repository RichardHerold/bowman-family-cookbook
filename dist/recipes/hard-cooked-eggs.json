    "COLD WATER METHOD:  Place eggs in saucepan; add enough cold water to come at least 1 inch above eggs.  Heat rapidly to boiling; remove from heat.  Cover and let stand 13 minutes.  Immediately cool eggs in cold water to prevent from further cooking.  Tap egg to crackle shell.  Roll egg between hands to loosen shell, then peel.  Hold egg under running cold water to help ease off shell."
