    "Ingredients:",
    "Preparation:",
    "Step 1:",
    "Brown ground chuck and then pour off the grease. This is purely a consideration for the consistency of the dip and should in no way be construed as a fat saving measure.",
    "Step 2:",
    "Dump in a bunch of the taco seasoning, hot picante sauce and hot cheese whiz. It’s sort of like a fancy ro-tel dip, only hotter and more fattening, on account of the beef.",
    "Step 3:",
    "This stuff is great on Fritos and or scoopable Tostito’s, as long as they are not the low fat baked variety. We are against those. This combo is so hot and so salty that you will quickly need lots of Margaritas.",
